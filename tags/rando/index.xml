      <description>A couple years ago I saw a post on hackernews for Art Garfunkel&amp;rsquo;s Library. That triggered my listing tendecies so I started to track the books I read on a spreadsheet. While I somewhat agree with the top comment, this practice has greatly increased my reading frequency and retention.
I&amp;rsquo;ve include some extra details to make this list mildly more interesting than a pure &amp;ldquo;checklist&amp;rdquo;. A short blurb that I wrote for most of the books when I finished them, and a few retroactive ones for this post.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost four years since setting up this blog and it&amp;rsquo;s still empty. I&amp;rsquo;m sure living up to that &amp;ldquo;easily distracted&amp;rdquo; tagline.
I plan to change this and actually make use of this space. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a decent backlog of material in various stages of complete. Hopefully some of it will make for good blog fodder. Assuming I can clean it up for publishing before getting distracted by some new shiny problem.</description>
