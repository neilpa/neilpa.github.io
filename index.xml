      <description>A couple years ago I saw a post on hackernews for Art Garfunkel&amp;rsquo;s Library. That triggered my listing tendecies so I started to track the books I read on a spreadsheet. While I somewhat agree with the top comment, this practice has greatly increased my reading frequency and retention.
I&amp;rsquo;ve include some extra details to make this list mildly more interesting than a pure &amp;ldquo;checklist&amp;rdquo;. A short blurb that I wrote for most of the books when I finished them, and a few retroactive ones for this post.</description>

      <description>Small example of setting up GitHub Actions to run on MacOS, Windows, and Linux with GitHub-hosted runners. In this case what a basic checkout, build, and test pass looks like in go.

      <description>The first post in a potential series to collect short snippets of web search results. This is an experiment to see if it helps better curate my notes. Also looking to for ways to reduce the barrier for writing/posting.

      <title>Naive ping-pong motion timing</title>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;ping-pong&amp;rdquo; in the title is catchy but a misnomer. The following derives the travel time across a line segment with max speed and acceleration. Starting from one of the endpoints and reversing direction at the opposite produces ping-pong-esque motion when repeated, hence the title.
 Note: Assumes max speed is actually reached but is easily adapted otherwise
 (0) This was derived from my $DAY_JOB1 so let&amp;rsquo;s use real values to motivate the example</description>

      <title>Fixing FreeBSD kernel panic with UHK keyboard</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using FreeBSD on and off as my desktop OS for a couple months (after ~5 years on OSX/macOS). Overall, I like the simplicity and design of the system. However, there&amp;rsquo;s been a non-trivial amount of hacking and debugging to get some things working.
Most recently I discovered that my new UHK keyboard causes a kernel panic when booting. Early in the boot process I was greeted with the following message (stack addresses omitted).</description>

      <title>Faces in the macOS photos library</title>

      <description>My photo collection is a mess. Getting it under control has proven a challenge in terms of de-dupe, metadata cleanup and just general organization. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried numerous photo management apps and online backup strategies over the years. That&amp;rsquo;s resulted in many different backups scattered across various thumbdrives and SD cards.
One such backup is a snapshot of the *.photoslibrary folder from my MacBook. This is where the builtin Photos.app (formerly iPhoto) stores files and metadata.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost four years since setting up this blog and it&amp;rsquo;s still empty. I&amp;rsquo;m sure living up to that &amp;ldquo;easily distracted&amp;rdquo; tagline.
I plan to change this and actually make use of this space. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a decent backlog of material in various stages of complete. Hopefully some of it will make for good blog fodder. Assuming I can clean it up for publishing before getting distracted by some new shiny problem.</description>
