      <title>Naive ping-pong motion timing</title>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;ping-pong&amp;rdquo; in the title is catchy but a misnomer. The following derives the travel time across a line segment with max speed and acceleration. Starting from one of the endpoints and reversing direction at the opposite produces ping-pong-esque motion when repeated, hence the title.
 Note: Assumes max speed is actually reached but is easily adapted otherwise
 (0) This was derived from my $DAY_JOB1 so let&amp;rsquo;s use real values to motivate the example</description>

      <title>Fixing FreeBSD kernel panic with UHK keyboard</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using FreeBSD on and off as my desktop OS for a couple months (after ~5 years on OSX/macOS). Overall, I like the simplicity and design of the system. However, there&amp;rsquo;s been a non-trivial amount of hacking and debugging to get some things working.
Most recently I discovered that my new UHK keyboard causes a kernel panic when booting. Early in the boot process I was greeted with the following message (stack addresses omitted).</description>

      <title>Faces in the macOS photos library</title>

      <description>My photo collection is a mess. Getting it under control has proven a challenge in terms of de-dupe, metadata cleanup and just general organization. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried numerous photo management apps and online backup strategies over the years. That&amp;rsquo;s resulted in many different backups scattered across various thumbdrives and SD cards.
One such backup is a snapshot of the *.photoslibrary folder from my MacBook. This is where the builtin Photos.app (formerly iPhoto) stores files and metadata.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost four years since setting up this blog and it&amp;rsquo;s still empty. I&amp;rsquo;m sure living up to that &amp;ldquo;easily distracted&amp;rdquo; tagline.
I plan to change this and actually make use of this space. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a decent backlog of material in various stages of complete. Hopefully some of it will make for good blog fodder. Assuming I can clean it up for publishing before getting distracted by some new shiny problem.</description>
