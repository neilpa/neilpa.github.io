  <p>It&rsquo;s been almost four years since setting up this blog and it&rsquo;s still empty. I&rsquo;m sure living up to that &ldquo;easily distracted&rdquo; tagline.</p>

<p>I plan to change this and actually make use of this space. I&rsquo;ve got a decent backlog of material in various stages of complete. Hopefully some of it will make for good blog fodder. Assuming I can clean it up for publishing before getting distracted by some new shiny problem.</p>

<p>One approach I&rsquo;m attemping is taking more notes when solving problems. That should provide an outline for posts that weren&rsquo;t solvable with a single google search. Who knows if it&rsquo;ll work long-term but should reduce the inertia to gettting started.</p>

<p>And to further hold my feet to the fire, next up is a post about exfiltrating face tag data out of the macOS Photos app.</p>
