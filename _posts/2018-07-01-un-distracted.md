title: Un-Distracted?
---

It's been almost four years since setting up this blog and it's still empty. I'm sure living up to that "easily distracted" tagline.

I plan to change this and actually make use of this space. I've got a decent backlog of material in various stages of complete. Hopefully some of it will make for good blog fodder. Assuming I can clean it up for publishing before getting distracted by some new shiny problem.

One approach I'm attemping is taking more notes when solving problems. That should provide an outline for posts that weren't solvable with a single google search. Who knows if it'll work long-term but should reduce the inertia to gettting started.

And to further hold my feet to the fire, next up is a post about exfiltrating face tag data out of the macOS Photos app.
